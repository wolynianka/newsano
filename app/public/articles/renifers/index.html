    Wild renifers  (reindeer) in Norway
  </title>
  <content>
    The Norwegian wild reindeer populations are currently managed in 23 more or less separate management areas in Southern Norway.
    In addition, Norway is responsible for species management on the Svalbard islands, which includes the management of the wild reindeer population there. 
    Divisions and delimitations on the mainland are the result of natural factors, human infrastructure and practical management considerations. The number of wild reindeer in winter totals roughly 25,000 animals, the largest population of 6,000 to 7,000 animals being found on Hardangervidda.
